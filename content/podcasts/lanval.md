  A romantic tail from the mythological times of King Arthur. Sir Lanval is a Knight of the Court of King Camelot. He is brave and good looking, chivalrous, and moral. But the other Knights of the Round Table do not like him. Perhaps his high moral tone irks them. As a result of his unpopularity, Lanval does not share in the rewards handed out by King Arthur. He falls into poverty, and, in despair, secretly leaves the court. On his travels he is wooed by a fairy queen, who gives him her love, and riches. The fairy queen makes one condition - he must not mention her to anyone. When he returns to Camelot, he attracts the eye of Queen Guinevere. He refuses her advances, and she decides to take revenge, making false accusations against him. It is based on the Lai of Lanval by Marie de France.

  The original was written in Anglo Norman. Ours is a modern interpretation in easy to understand verse.

  The story refers to some grown up themes. We trust you will find the magical and romantic story calming and diverting from the cares of modern life! Sit or lie back, and enjoy the story of a medieval Knight.

  The Lai of Lanval

  Lanval, a knight of the court of Camelot

  Handsome, Brave, one of the best

  Not as famed as Gawain or Lancelot

  But perhaps more honest.

  He was

  Envied

  by the rest.

  Noone doubted that he was good and true

  Fierce in war and kind in peace

  Generous and open, they all knew

  Constant, steady, no caprice

  Only one thing he lacked in its entirety

  That slippery quality:  popularity.

  For unfortunately,

  His nobility

  Made other  knights feel

  Their moral fragility.

  In fact, scheming eyes could not wait

  To see him meet some unpleasant fate.

  Well, let us begin the story.

  Arthur and his knights had spent a while

  One summer in the cold city of Carlisle

  Up North to fight the troublesome Scots

  Who back then were a scrappy lot.

  50 days they had fought

  The men in kilts

  And much blood had spilt

  Then the  feast of Pentecost came

  and they thought

  They had time and cause

  To pause their war

  And pursuit of glory and immortal fame

  And to care, instead, for their bodies and souls.

  So

  Knights on their knees said their prayers

  And sung their psalms

  Then escorted ladies on their arms

  through the fairs

  And clamouring crowds

  With much celebration,

  Festive feasting, and inebriation

  Jousting, music, Dancing

  Moonlit walks and talks of love

  Sweet kisses and entrancing

  For noble Knights knew how to woo

  Just as well as to pursue.

  That summer was meant to be

  A time of plenty.

  The King was a man of means

  And knights were on the receiving end of things.

  If a knight wished to be wed

  Arthur set him up with a wife

  And homestead

  Lands for the gentry

  Gold and silver aplenty.

  For each loyal knight of the table that was round

  Some rich gift had to be found.

  Save for one.

  Lanval received no lady’s hand

  Still less a plot of  land

  No gold

  No Silver

  No bronze

  No cloak of ermine did  he don

  Lanval alone of all the noble knights

  Received

  Not a fig

  Not a word

  Not a nod

  He was  forgotten

  It was more than odd.

  And unfortunately

  He was falling, falling into penury

  For knighthood demands not just arms and might

  It takes money, and plenty, to fight the good fight

  Horses and grooms don’t lodge for free

  And knights can’t turn away the poor and needy

  Without loss of name, fame and nobility

  Indeed

  Their castle halls are often filled

  with the grasping and the greedy

  And while they’re away fighting wars

  Their stewards steal from their stores

  Their cooks guzzle down their wine

  And servants help themselves to all that is fine

  So one summer night in Carlisle

  Lanval awoke

  In his bed

  Alone

  And  broke.

  He who knew no fear

  Who in battle engaged any enemy

  Sweated and felt queer

  He could not face his poverty

  He groaned.

  Far away from home

  In a state of lonely distress

  At a moonlit hour, he stood up, and dressed.

  The forlorn knight

  went to find his horse once fine,

  Whose mane had lost its shine

  Whose neigh had lost its delight

  He saddled him up himself

  Mounted, and began to ride

  Clattering through the half-deserted streets

  Past the sleeping retreats

  Of Arthur’s men in temporary lodgings

  With chests of rich belongings

  Who lied

  Beside their one-night brides.

  He rode out of the city and along the river

  Called Eden

  Because its banks are so green and fertile

  And after he had ridden a while

  And after the summer sun had risen in style

  He grew hot, and his old horse began to sweat and quiver

  And so he lied down in a field beside the cool river

  And fell into a deep deep sleep

  He was in no hurry

  For once, without worry

  And when he opened his eyes

  He saw, a heavenly surprise,

  Two girls, among the loveliest he had seen

  Dressed in purple with white lace

  Each with a face

  That made him feel alive

  Like sprinkles of  sweet spring water on his  eyes

  “Sir Knight,” one girl  spoke,  “there is a lady who makes no pretence

  She is impatient for your attendance

  at her side

  For if what her heart tells her is right

  When  she saw you ride

  by her pavillion

  It was love at first sight.

  So come, and on her fair forehead you may set your gaze

  We have reason to think you will be amazed.”

  Pavilion? He had not seen any structure made by human hands

  He had only ridden past green and pleasant lands.

  They led  him by both hands  until

  Upon a hill

  They came to the lady's tent.

  It stood beside an ancient apple tree

  Held up by poles of gold and gilded cord

  Its sides were made of rich tapestry

  Each flap was more than a king could afford

  They depicted histories in their scenes

  Dido,  the Carthaginian Queen

  Cleopatra

  Semiramis

  Zenobia -

  And Sheba of Ethiopia.

  inside

  He found the lady who had summoned him

  Her shapely form

  Lying on a bed like bud on a branch in may

  The cover she had pushed away

  To be the cooler, it was sweltering that summer’s day

  All she wore was a slip of silk

  He could see

  Her neck, her arms, her bosom

  All as white as milk

  Or a lilly

  Or the hawthorn flower.

  “Lanval,” she said, in a voice lined with velvet power

  “Sweet love,  you are dear to me, so step forward and sit near to me.

  I have heard that you are courtly and true.

  Because of you

  I have journeyed from my land

  I understand

  That you are rich in honour, honesty and courage

  Though despite these precious gifts

  You may require a helping hand.

  I have no art

  I speak from the heart

  I love you

  And want to help you.”

  And when he heard these words

  Love struck him like a spark

  And desire set  fire to his heart

  “Lovely one,” he said.

  “Your wish is my command

  I will never leave you

  I will always believe you

  I shall  do anything you demand

  Foolish or wise

  For you

  And only you

  Anything you say

  It is my greatest joy to obey.”

  And when she heard that Sir Lanval was ready to give himself to her

  She gave herself to him

  Her love and her body

  Now at last Lanval was progressing!

  And when they had done with their caressing

  She offered him another gift:

  Anything he might need, no matter what the expense

  From henceforth

  Make no mistaking

  It was his for the taking.

  He only had to say

  And she would send it his way.

  “Do not doubt what I have told you.

  My word is as good as gold for you.

  No more need to be poor.

  So long as you stay true to me

  Wealthy, you shall always be”

  He thanked her kindly, as you might expect

  In one whose manners were so perfect.

  But then she added one condition

  “You must obey this, my command,  or  suffer the perdition

  Of losing me,

  My love

  My body

  And never again will you enjoy my generosity

  If one word of our union slips from your lips

  Your sorrow will follow swiftly on the morrow.

  Mention me, and I’ll be lost to you, you’ll see.

  And this is what I truly think:

  Your fortunes, once more, will sink.

  But my love, there is no need to fret

  So long as this one stipulation

  You do not forget.”

  And when he understood what she wanted

  He was quite undaunted.

  Sir Lanval did not hesitate to agree

  To swear an oath of total secrecy.

  And then he closed his eyes

  And he would have lied by his lover’s side

  For many blissful hours

  But instead

  She ordered him out of bed

  “You can’t stay here,” she said.

  The maids came with water and robes

  And washed and dressed him in the richest clothes

  Then the lovers sat down to dine on fine dishes

  And between the dishes

  The sweetest kisses.

  After dinner, the maids brought him his own horse

  Watered, rested and restored to health.

  “Lover,” said his lady.  “Any time you miss

  My conversation or my kiss

  Call me, and say my secret name - which she told him -

  And I shall come

  Instantly

  Invisibly

  Save to you

  My love who is true.”

  So, Sir Lanval

  More content than he had ever felt

  The picture of confidence and wealth

  Was ready to begin

  His journey to the nearest inn.

  And on his arrival

  Before he took his rest

  He paid for food and drink for all the guests.

  And thereafter,  wherever he went

  He freely spent

  And no one knew who was this handsome man

  Who did not stint

  To pay a jailed knight’s ransom

  Or to clothe a juggler who was skint.

  And no one knew that

  It was his secret delight

  To call his fairy lover each and every night.

  And far as anyway knew

  He was alone in his life

  And had no lover

  Nor a wife.

  It was sometime past midsummer’s day

  When Sir Lanval was on his way

  Little did he know that a lady’s eye

  Spied on him as he rode by

  She was hidden, but near

  In a tower up on high

  Her name, was Queen Guinevere

  And not so long after, when the days were still hot

  Perhaps by chance

  But maybe not

  Sir Lanval met Sir Gwain in the inn

  Sir Gwain greeted him

  With open arms

  And did not lack for charm

  “Sir, we have missed your presence at  my uncle’s court

  if there was anything we ought

  To have done for you.

  Please accept my apology.

  It is my feeling we may have wronged you.

  It pains me.

  I feel the deepest regret.

  Believe me.

  Sir Lanval.

  We did not mean to forget you.”

  Generous was the nature of Lanval

  And freely, of his own will

  Perhaps more than he ought

  He found it easy to forgive.

  So he returned to court with Sir Gwain forthwith

  And if you care for Sir Lanval’s sake

  You might feel that this was

  His biggest mistake.

  So far….

  The following Sunday

  When the court was supposedly at prayers

  The Queen was giving him stares

  And at every chance

  She sent him the most artful glance

  Her intent

  And what she meant

  Lanval  perceived precisely

  But though he liked to treat a lady nicely

  There was nothing he might give her

  What she wanted,

  He could not deliver.

  But the more he resisted

  The more the queen persisted

  Somehow she was always near

  To the noble knight whom she found so dear

  One day, when he was  alone, in an orchard

  deep in thought

  She found him, and he was caught.

  “Lanval,” she said, temptingly.

  “When others neglected you

  I always respected you

  And then,

  When you disappeared

  The worst I feared

  I could not sleep.

  I realised my love for you ran deep.

  And  when thankfully you returned

  How my passion  sparked and burned!

  I am yours for the taking!

  Why are you waiting?

  This is the season  for our love making! “

  But though the queen was ready to give her all

  Lanval was not at all enthralled.

  He was not like other men she had met

  For whom adultery was a step they would not regret.

  “My queen,” he said.

  “I am flattered with all my being.

  I am honoured by all you mention

  And thank you for your attention

  But please understand

  I cannot be your man.

  For this reason

  It would be treason.

  I serve your husband

  As his knight, loyal and true

  And to wrong him

  Would be the very worst

  I could do.”

  “What is this?” exclaimed the queen.

  “You resist my kiss?

  Your effete manners I held dear

  Now I see how far I was mistaken

  My love is forsaken

  Because….You, Gallant Knight

  Are a queer!

  “My lady I assure you I am not.” exclaimed Sir Lanval quite shocked

  “Your lies cannot disguise it any more.

  It’s well understood.

  That It’s quite common among the brotherhood.

  Oh you hunky knights!

  I know how you spend those summer nights!

  Now it’s clear why you had to disappear

  You went off to enjoy

  Your  friend

  Who is A boy!”

  “No no,” pleaded Sir Lanval. “I love another, that much is true.  That is why I cannot be with you. “

  “Oh now you make me grieve!

  Stop this nonsense - This make-believe!

  ….Or else,

  If what you claim is true

  Tell me

  Who? Who Is she?

  This secret lady

  Whom you prefer so much to me!

  Much beauty must she posses

  But her Identity, I cannot guess.”

  “Well, since you ask,

  She’s  a lady whose beauty does surpass

  All other women I have seen

  And that includes you

  My queen.”

  “Well now. That was a low blow.

  Your good manners, Sir Knight,

  are not quite what they seem.”

  Though it was his courtly code to be polite

  When his blood was up,  he was not one to retreat from a fight.

  He was far from finished yet.

  He had much more to say that he would bitterly regret.

  “My lady’s lowliest handmaid

  The poorest creature

  Of the humblest station

  Is more beautifully made

  In body, and in face,

  And in education

  Than you

  In fact her whole retinue

  Is far exceeding

  In manners and in breeding

  And In all that is beautiful and true!”

  Oh Sir Lanval!

  What have you just said?

  Not only, have you broken your troth of delicate secrecy

  You have all but lost your handsome head.

  Surely you should know

  That the queen will  NEVER  let a comment like that go?

  She is wounded in this verbal fight

  But she knows how to pierce her noble knight

  No shining armour will protect you.

  From the weapons she shall  project at you!

  So don’t be taken by surprise

  When they start to fly

  Those poisoned and pointed lies

  This was her track

  And her line of attack.

  In those dark and mediaeval times

  The love of man on man

  Was a crime.

  And if you were so inclined

  Your life was always on the line.

  And even if you weren’t

  The mere suspicion could get you burnt.

  Unless of course you were a lord or a king

  Which meant, like now, you could get away with anything.

  The queen waited In the bridal room

  Where she prepared the most shameless stunt.

  She messed up her hair and scratched her own face

  She was a right… disgrace.

  And when Arthur  returned from the hunt

  She was crying

  She was sick

  And the more she was tearful

  The more fearful became the king

  “Did you fall? Did you hurt yourself my dear?

  You can tell me now, I am here.”

  Then she spoke a terrible thing.

  She was sick

  Because a Knight of the Round Table

  Had played an ignoble trick.

  Sir Lanval had advanced upon her

  And when she commanded him to be gone

  And reminded him that she was loyal to only one

  He broke down in the most queer tears

  And sobbed out his heart to the queen

  Like a girl of fourteen

  And only then

  Did he confess

  What they all should have guessed

  That what what Sir Lanval was really after

  At the court of King Arthur

  Was men.

  King Arthur was outraged!

  How could he let Camalot be so defamed

  By the love that dare not speak its name!

  What would their enemies say?

  They would laugh at them all the way

  Into battle

  So If this crime could be proved

  The stain had to be removed!

  A court was swiftly convened

  And Lanval was brought before it.

  There sat the tearful queen

  The King

  And all his lords

  As well as a curious crowd

  All there to see Sir Lanval be demeaned.

  The accusation was read out loud

  Including

  All the dirt that Arthur’s spies could find

  All the meanest gossip

  That appealed to the lowest minds.

  And to this, Lanval replied

  The only part  of this accusation that is true

  Are the words that I told the queen

  That I faithfully serve

  A lady

  Who is the loveliest I have ever seen.

  And every knight who was there

  Well knew  that the accusations were unfair

  But none of them would dare

  To speak in defence of him

  When to do so, was to go against the king

  Save one

  Sir Guain

  Who was Arthur’s Brother’s son

  “I have always found Sir Lanval to be

  A valiant knight

  Who has stood firm in many a fight

  And who has been

  A good friend to me.

  But this I do own

  He likes to be alone.

  And when he stands aloof

  Some like to see that as proof.

  He thinks that only he is free from sin

  And looks down on those around him.

  But the mean words that we have heard spoken

  Were first meant as a joke

  A low attack

  A stab

  In the back

  Of an all round

  Good bloke.

  But here, today, they are taken seriously as fact.

  That can’t be right

  Someone needs to take those words back.”

  But Sir Gwain’s loyal defence

  Only caused the King the greatest offence

  “Impudent youth!

  It is my wife you accuse

  Of playing fast and loose with the truth.

  If Lanval’s plea is to be believed

  Let him show us the proof.

  Where is his lovely lady whom no one else has seen.

  Is she some sort of invisible fairy queen? “

  Sir Gwain’s keen eyes looked all around

  Surely somewhere in this crowd, his friend’s lover could be found?

  Whom Sir Lanval was too honourable to name

  For to call her, in court, would cause her shame.

  And Sir Gwain was soon aware of a suspicous pair

  Seated side by side,

  Like sisters

  Their silken finery could not hide

  Their

  Features and forms

  Most pleasing to the eye.

  Sir Lanval, he said,  nodding toward the two beauties.

  Is one of them your love?

  No, replied he, I swear by the Lord above,

  I’ve not seen them before.

  And soon after, two more arrived,

  Whose beauty outshone

  Not only the first two,

  But all the women who were in view

  Eclipsing even the queen

  And, it could  be conceived

  Every woman who had ever breathed.

  And I must say

  No Knight of the round table could keep his eyes away.

  And each everyone thought

  By God!

  There must be

  Sir Lanval’s lovely lady

  And the sort who were more depraved in mind.

  Assumed he kept two of the same kind

  But instead

  Sir Lanval Shook his head

  And denied it.

  And Arthur

  Conscious that his impatient queen

  Was restless for justice to be seen

  Called on his lords for a guilty verdict

  For he thought his case was won.

  But the expression on Sir Lanval’s face

  Was far from the picture of disgrace

  His lips turned up and his eyes shone

  For he had spotted his beloved one!

  Just in the nick of time she had arrived,

  an arabian horse she did ride.

  The whole town upon her gazed

  And each and everyone was amazed

  by her beauty

  And her silken finery.

  Even the angry king was completely charmed

  And all his army was quite disarmed.

  Your Majesty, Declared she

  I have come to prove your prisoner not guilty!

  He never spoke an untrue thing

  And has always remained loyal to his king.

  Only in one way has he strayed

  When he mentioned me, he broke his oath of sacred secrecy

  I am the one he has betrayed.

  And Sir Lanval fell to his knees and begged his lady please

  to forgive.

  As Long as he lived

  For all his days

  He would regret that brash boast that he had made.

  “Lanval,’ said she.

  I gave you fair warning.

  If you mentioned one word of me

  Retribution would come for you quite swiftly

  And it must be said

  You almost lost your head.

  The  Jealous Queen got you by the throat

  And your comrade knights

  Wanted you as their scapegoat.

  For every act they have accused you of

  They are ten times more guilty

  And their greatest sin I see

  Is Rank, Stinking Hypocrisy!”

  And when I look around this court full of men whom I detest

  I still see that you are far better than the rest

  So, Lanval, my love,

  Mount your horse and follow me.

  For I have come to rescue thee.
