Hello, this is Jana, and welcome to Relaxivity, a place where you can spend a little time for yourself. We bring you stories of a quiet, spiritual nature, as well as poems and meditations. Listen when you want to relax or fall asleep.

  This is a love poem by DH Lawrence - just in time for Valentine’s day. But it isn’t about fiery passion, it’s about a slow-burning and long-lasting love.

  ## The Elephant is Slow to Mate

  The elephant, the huge old beast,is slow to mate;

  He finds a female, they show no haste they wait

  For the sympathy in their vast shy hearts slowly, slowly to rouse

  As they loiter along the river-beds and drink and browse

  And dash in panic through the brake of forest with the herd,

  And sleep in massive silence, and wake together, without a word.

  So slowly the great hot elephant hearts grow full of desire,

  And the great beasts mate in secret at last hiding their fire.

  Oldest they are and the wisest of beasts so they know at last

  How to wait for the loneliest of feasts for the full repast.

  They do not snatch, they do not tear; their massive blood

  Moves as the moon-tides, near, more near till they touch in flood.
